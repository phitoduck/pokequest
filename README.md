It's totally fine if these instructions don't make sense. Following them blindly
will lead you to success!

### Step 1 - `clone` this `repository`

`clone` just means download a copy

1. install git if you don't have it on your computer. `git` is a command that downloads this folder.
   1. Open up `iTerm` on your mac

   3. If it didn't work, install `git`. (type `brew install git`) Ta-da! The last step should give a different result now.

2. Click the green `clone` link

### Step 1 - Setup a `virtual environment`

The point of this step is to create a copy of
